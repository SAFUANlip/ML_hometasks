with all hearts \\n which by lacking have supposed dead \\n and there reigns love and all love loving parts \\n and all those friends which thought buried \\n how many holy and obsequious tear\\n hath dear religious love stol from mine eye \\n as interest of the dead which now appear\\n but things remov that hidden in thee lie \\n thou art the grave where buried love doth live \\n hung with the

vouchsafe me but this loving thought \\n had my friend muse grown with this growing age dearer birth than this his love had brought \\n to march in ranks of better equipage \\n but since he died and poets better prove \\n theirs for their style ll read his for his love \\n\\n xxxiii\\n\\n full many glorious morning have seen\\n flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye \\n kissing with golden face the meadows green \\n gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy \\n anon permit the basest clouds to ride\\n with ugly rack on his celestial face \\n and from the forlorn world his visage hide \\n stealing unseen to west with this disgrace \\n even so my sun one early morn did shine \\n with all triumphant splendour on my brow \\n but out alack he was but one hour mine \\n the region cloud hath mask him from me now \\n yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth \\n suns of the world may stain when heaven sun staineth \\n\\n xxxiv\\n\\n why didst thou promise such beauteous day \\n and make me travel forth without my cloak \\n to let base clouds ertake me in my way \\n hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke \\n tis not enough that through the cloud thou break \\n to dry the rain on my storm beaten face \\n for no man well of such salve can speak \\n that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace \\n nor can thy shame give physic to my grief \\n though thou repent yet have still the loss \\n the offender sorrow lends but weak relief\\n to him that bears the strong offence cross \\n ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds \\n and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds \\n\\n xxxv\\n\\n no more be griev at that which thou hast done \\n roses have thorns and silver fountains mud \\n clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun \\n and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud \\n all men make faults and even in this \\n authorizing thy trespass with compare \\n myself corrupting salving thy amiss \\n excusing thy sins more than thy sins are \\n for to thy

to be prais of ages yet to be \\n then do thy office muse teach thee how\\n to make him seem long hence as he shows now \\n\\n cii\\n\\n my love is strengthen though more weak in seeming love not less though less the show appear \\n that love is merchandiz whose rich esteeming \\n the owner tongue doth publish every where \\n our love was new and then but in the spring \\n when was wont to greet it with my lays \\n as philomel in summer front doth sing \\n and stops her pipe in growth of riper days \\n not that the summer is less pleasant now\\n than when her mournful hymns did hush the night \\n but that wild music burthens every bough \\n and sweets grown common lose their dear delight \\n therefore like her sometime hold my tongue \\n because would not dull you with my song \\n\\n

incertainties now crown themselves assur and peace proclaims olives of endless age \\n now with the drops of this most balmy time \\n my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes \\n since spite of
